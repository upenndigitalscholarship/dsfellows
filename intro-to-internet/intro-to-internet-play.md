## Scene One where Laurie gets a static page

**You:** Hey Browser. Show me this webpage. (http://www.upenndigitalscholarship.org/internet/learning.html)

**Browser:** - Hey Computer. Can I get on the internet? We gotta show Laurie this webpage.

**Computer:** Sure thing! We seem to be all hooked up to the internet, so I don't see a problem.

*[My agent begins her travels.]*

*[Goes to DNS office]*

**Agent:**  Hey Domain Name Service, Laurie's agent here. I’m looking for upenndigitalscholarship.org. Can you tell me where to go?

**DNS** - Ah. Ok. I see that the University of Pennsylvania Libraries has signed up for that domain name. They’ve got a server running on a computer over there in a server farm provided by Reclaim Hosting. They should be serving up that site at 128.39.28.2833

**Agent.** Got it. On my way!
*[travels to "cloud", which is one of many warehouses full of computers that store and serve the sites you visit. These warehouses full of computers are staffed and require massive electricity and temperature controls. The huge quantity of water required for cooling these warehouses has real environmental consequences. There is no cloud. There are wires and computers on earth.]*

**Agent:** Hellooo 128.39.28.2833. I heard you have a web server on this computer here. I'm going to go in and look for the files I'm searching for, cool?

**Server:** Yes. Welcome. What page would you like?

**Agent:** Well, I seem to be looking for a directory called "internet", ah. I see you've got that folder, I'll just take a look. I'm trying to find a file called "learning.html"?

**Server:** *[looking in folder]* Yep. Here's that file. 
*[Looks at it. ]*
It’s an html page -- great! Off you go!!

**Agent** – *[taking learning.html]* Come on, buddy! I’ll show you the way back to Laurie’s computer.

**Laurie’s computer -** You’re back! Thanks! Hey browser, here you go. This html page is coming through.

**Browser:** Got it. Wait! It says here that I need a couple of other files -- would you run and grab these css and javascript files for me

**Computer:** Yep. I’ll see what I can do. I’ll assume they’re on the computer I just came from, unless they say otherwise in the address. What's the address on those?

**Browser:** Ok. I need 2. Can you run and grab those?

**Agent:** No problem at all. 

*[begins trip over again - brings back css file]*

Here they are!

**Browser:** Great! In that mini-millisecond I started loading the page, but now I'll make it look nice. *[continues loading page]* Got it all! Thanks!!

**Internet:** Any time, friend!



## Scene Two, where Laurie gets a page made by a database

**You** Hey, Browser, I want to go to upenndigitalscholarship.org/bananas

**Browser** You got it! I'll check to see if I can find that.

*[goes through computer hooked up to internet]*

**Agent** Hey, DNS, I'm looking for upenndigitalscholarship.org, could you tell me where to go?

**DNS** Right this way!

*[to Server]* **Agent** Hey Server, I'm looking for a page called "Bananas" in this domain, can you help me out?

**Server** *[rifles through file]* *[confused]* Ummmm... I don't think I have anything like that here. I'm going to have to give you one of these.

*[hands AGENT a post-it.]*

**Agent** 404 Page not found?? Alright, guess better let Laurie know. 

**You** Aww drat, looks like there isn't a page with that URL. Well let me try upenndigitalscholarship.org/admin

**Browser** Alright!

**Agent** Hey DNS, looking for upenndigitalscholarship.org again

**DNS** You know where to go!

*[to server]* **Agent** Hey server, me again. Looking for upenndigitalscholarship.org/admin this time.

**Server** *[goes through file again]* Excuse me, looks like you're not allowed on this page. Admin only. I'll have to give you one of these. *[hands AGENT a post-it]*

**Agent** Awww man, 403 Forbidden?? Laurie's going to be so bummed. 

**You** Guess I can't access that page either! Oh well, better luck next time. I wonder if http://upenndigitalscholarship.org/omeka-example/ would be easier to access?

**Agent** Server, do you have anything under http://upenndigitalscholarship.org/omeka-example/?

**Server** This might get a little complicated. I'll need to consult my database for instructions on how to build your page. *[looks through folder]* All right, here's a template. *[places a piece of paper with a website layout drawn on it on the table]* And here's some content to fill it in. *[puts header, menu, and page content into the template]*

**Agent** Thanks, server! It's beautiful!
