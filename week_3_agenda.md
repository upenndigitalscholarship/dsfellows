+ How can we think of digital technologies as continuous with earlier manuscript and print cultures, rather than representing an absolute break?

## Early modern information technologies

### One genealogy of information management practices

+ Scroll -> book -> digital text? (cf. Stallybrass)
  + A scroll needs to be read continuously. The book combines "the ability to scroll with the capacity for random access," and digital texts do the same, offering a "scroll function" and the "ability, through bookmarks, to have our fingers in many different places at the same time, and to move rapidly from one to another" (Stallybrass, *Books and Scrolls*, 42)
+ Christianity played a significant role in transition from scroll to codex, and development of textual finding aids that we still use today
  + 4th century debates over whether the codex or the scroll was the superior form for religious texts
  + 13th century: rise of navigational aids for Christian bibles (e.g. concordances, alphabetical indexes, library catalogues)
    + On the alphabetized index: "At first, the alphabetic system that we take for granted was actively resisted, because it led to arbitrary relations between words and even to logical inversions, in which the created preceded the creator (Filia coming before Pater, Angelus before Deus) and inversions of social hierarchy (Filia coming before Filius, Mater before Pater)." (Stallybrass, *Books and Scrolls*, 44)
  + 15th century invention of printing press -> these developments began to be more systematically used in printed books (including consistent pagination, tables of contents, running titles)

### Geneva Bible, bound with Robert Herrey's concordance (1581)

+ Translation and edition of the Bible predating the King James by 51 years; one of the first mass-produced printed Bibles to be made available to the general public
+ This is one text Stallybrass uses as an example of how early modern Bibles made new forms of discontinuous reading possible
+ Open to a random page: what kind of information do we get, besides what we might think of as the "text" of the Bible?
+ Looking at the title page: why advertise the presence of a concordance? What is a concordance, and what does it do for the reader? Why two concordances?
  + (Stallybrass: first alphabet proliferates meanings, second controls against that proliferation; "anti-Catholic slant". see entry for Abominable)
+ What types of reading do these paratexts promote?
+ What can you do with this text that you couldn't do with a scroll?
+ Evidence of readers' interactions with it (marginalia on p. 179; other traces?)
+ If you were to create a digitized version of this text, how would you do it? or: does the textual apparatus bear any resemblance to digital methods of navigating through texts you've used?
  + Arguably, first DH project was [Father Roberto Busa's](http://stephenramsay.us/2011/08/11/father-roberto-busa/) creation of a computer-generated [concordance](http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age) to the works of Thomas Aquinas
+ Skeumorphism:

> "[M]y Macintosh computer still uses a little hand to travel around the screen and a pointing finger. And when I find a new website, I add a 'bookmark,' visualized nostalgically at the top of my screen as a blue ribbon. The navigation of computers is still imagined in the visual language that was elaborated in the fifteenth century for the navigation of books: the language of the index finger and of its prosthetic form, the bookmark." (46)

### Printers' ornaments

+ Parallel with Bootstrap elements?

## Anatomizing the language, indexing the novel

+ *A Dictionary of the English Language* (1755): one of the first comprehensive English-language dictionaries, prepared by Samuel Johnson and a group of assistants between 1746 and 1755 (copying passages by hand or physically cutting them out of the source material)
+ *Sir Charles Grandison* (1754), first edition: epistolary novel by Samuel Richardson
+ Richardson was one of the only contemporary novelists extensively quoted in Johnson's dictionary
+ Just flipping through, what do you notice about how *Grandison* is organized?
+ Where do the footnotes direct you? (see v.7, pp. 191 and 202)
+ See title page: why advertise the presence of an index? And why include an index? What does it do for the reader?
+ (Johnson requested an inclusion of an index to *Clarissa* in order to make it easier for “the busy, the aged, and the studious” to return to particular passages; Richardson added the index in a reprint, and a similar one appears here in *Grandison*, his next novel)
+ Definitions for "plication" and "quaggy" in Johnson: difficulties of life without keyword search
+ How would you go about finding a passage in *Grandison* or *Clarissa* if you didn't know its exact location? (see entries for "rakish" and "rampant", which successfully quote from Richardson)
+ Can you find a quote about rakes or rakishness in *Grandison* without having read the text?
+ "A study of *Clarissa* [another of Richardson's novels] alongside the Dictionary shows that nearly all of Johnson’s quotations from *Clarissa* were lifted directly from the table, the *index rerum*, with only a couple of notable exceptions." (Valenza, *How Literature Becomes Knowledge*, 219)
+ What would change if you were able to perform a keyword search on those texts? Is there anything you couldn't find, but might be able to find with the print book's finding aids?
+ Do the finding aids in *Grandison* look like anything you've seen in digital materials?
+ What’s the physical experience of looking something up in one of these books like? (vs. using some form of digital search?)
+ In what space might you encounter books like these? A library? A home? How much did they cost, and who would have access? (vs. various types of digital texts?)
+ 18th c and contemporary anxieties about "index-learning"

> A clearer sense of the role indices played for Johnson might be gained by noting that Pope’s mock praise of “index-learning” might be doubly applied to its modern equivalent—database (or search-engine) learning. The apparent comprehensiveness of a modern database, in which potentially no word is left uncataloged, thoroughly relieves the reader of the obligation to read the whole of anything. And although Swift worries that “large Indexes, and little Compendiums” might come to replace real study, and the *Dunciad*’s satire gestures towards the prevalence of such study (careless, slippery, and dangerous though it may be), these satires also, perhaps despite themselves, gesture towards the usefulness of index-learning. (Valenza 222)

## Note-taking and the commonplace book

> "Aristotle suggests that readers should “select . . . from the written handbooks of argument, and should draw up sketch-lists of them upon each several kind of subject, putting them down under separate headings, e.g. ‘On Good,’ or ‘On Life’-and that ‘On Good’ should deal with every form of good, beginning with the category of essence.” In its medieval incarnation, students (and scholars) would copy and subsequently memorize quotations gleaned from their read- ing, arranging them under various general topics. Locke recommended the same (with some suggested headings) in his seventeenth-century educational writings. The quotations thus identified could then serve as evidence for an argument." (Valenza 220)

+ We won't have time to look at any today, but Penn has some in its collections; see also these [digitized](http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html) commonplace books
+ How does this relate to the other materials we've looked at?
+ What use might it have served for its creator?
+ How does this compare to your (digital or non-digital) notetaking practices? To forms of online information organization like the ones we've talked about?

#Maps and Monuments-- how we conceptualize city and expression

##Key Concepts

1. What is the relationship between a monument and the city it belongs in
2. How does cartography change the way we conceptualize cities?
3. What do we lose or gain from maps that are digitized
4. What is a monument?
5. How have monuments changed?
6. What is the purpose of a monument? What can we learn from monuments?
7. Monument Lab-- how does this project define monuments in the city of Philadelphia?
8. What data have we gathered from Monument Lab?
9. Group Project
